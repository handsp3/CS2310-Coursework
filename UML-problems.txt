UML Issues:

- The names of parameters are not shown, we need to show them. The UML must conform with the techniques we have
  learned in software engineering. Look at software engineering tutorial answers for some examples. The format is
	paramName : paramType, ...

- The package names are listed under class names rather than using the actual package element. Classes in the
  same package should be grouped together in a package box.

- The performer class has the wrong relation. It is not stored in DanceGroup, it is used by Dance and DanceShow,
  so should have an association relationship with those classes and not with DanceGroup.

- Other relationships in the diagram use the incorrect, you should use composition and aggregation relations to
  show where a class is stored as an instance within another.

- You should move the attributes listed on relations in the class itself, it makes the diagram more readable.

- You have put a constructor in the AstaireFileReader class but there is none in the class definition itself.

- We have made changes to some classes since Monday. You should look at the classes to see what has changed and 
  update your UML accordingly. This mostly includes removal, addition or editing of fields.If you want an easy 
  way to see what has changed look at the 'outline' box in your eclipse window, it shows you all of the methods
  and fields in the class, just make sure to look at the method to see the parameter names.
